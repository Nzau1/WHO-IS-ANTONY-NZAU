    <h1>Education Background</h1>
    <p>For my Education Background</p>
    <p>My academic journey has been a foundation for my growth in coding and design. It all started at TITO Schools (2012 - 2016), where I built my early academic skills and developed a passion for technology.

        I then advanced to Siakago Boys High School (2017 - 2020), where I honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, laying the groundwork for my interest in programming and digital innovation.
        
        Currently, I am pursuing my higher education at Mount Kenya University (2021 - 2025), where I am expanding my expertise in technology, software development, and design. Alongside my formal education, I have taken the initiative to enhance my skills through specialized online courses.
        
        In 2023, I completed a short course at ALX, diving deeper into modern programming techniques, and I continued my learning journey with another ALX program in 2024, focusing on advanced coding, problem-solving, and real-world application of tech solutions.
        
        These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of coding and design, allowing me to build innovative and impactful projects. ðŸš€</p>
